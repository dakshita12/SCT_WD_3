Quiz Game Application

This is a fully functional Quiz Game Web Application built as Task 3 of my Web Development Internship at SkillCraft Technology. The project involves creating an interactive, multiple-choice quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with dynamic rendering and real-time scoring.


## üìù Task Objective

The primary goal was to build an engaging and interactive quiz game that:

- Dynamically displays multiple-choice questions  
- Collects and processes user answers  
- Calculates and displays the final score upon completion  


## ‚ö° What I Worked On

- DOM manipulation for dynamic question and option rendering  
- Event handling for answer selection and navigation  
- State management to track current question, score, and responses  
- Score calculation logic with feedback based on user performance  
- UI enhancements using CSS for smooth transitions and interaction
